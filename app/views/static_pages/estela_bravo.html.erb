        Estela Bravo was born in New York City in 1933.  She attended Brooklyn College and later worked for the International Fur and Leather Workers Union. Her life changed in 1953, when she met Ernesto Bravo, a physician, activist and survivor of repression in Peronist Argentina, at the World Youth Conference in Warsaw. In 1955 she left the United States for Buenos Aires, marrying Ernesto a year later. In the early 1960s, when the Cuban government of Fidel Castro invited Ernesto Bravo to join the University of Havana Medical School, the Bravos moved to Havana.

         A decade later, Estela Bravo, who had been working on Cuban children’s television programming, was given the opportunity to do a film on the relationship between Cubans and Miami Cubans. That first effort, Those Who Left (1980), led to a four decade-long career in documentary filmmaking that continues to take the Bravos around the world. Initially chronicling the troubled relationship between her native country and her adopted home, Estela Bravo has gone on to use the camera to document radical activism and social justice movements throughout Latin America, particularly in Ernesto Bravo’s native Argentina and in Chile during the Pinochet era.

Enjoying privileged access to key Cuban figures, including Fidel Castro, Estela Bravo has also been able to create an important visual record of Cuban internationalism, most notably in Angola, Grenada and Namibia. Estela Bravo’s films have won several awards, including the Silver Hugo Award from the Chicago International Film Festival and an “Outstanding Achievement in Documentary Award” from the Global Village Documentary Festival.
